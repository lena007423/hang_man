txt = "Personally, one of the biggest reasons why I love quotes is because of how relatable they can be. Quotes tend to be simplistic and easy to remember and they echo what is in our hearts. Plus I think quotes are very effective to better yourself because they help your mind focus on particular topics at a time. Unlike other literary tools quotes, and short quotes, in particular, give you the ability to concentrate on one idea with no outside distractions.So whether it’s for self-motivation, your next t-shirt design, or simply for your Instagram bio, this collection of short quotes is full of powerful ideas packed into tiny little packages of words. They have made a profound positive impact in my life and I’m sure they will make one in yours as well."
